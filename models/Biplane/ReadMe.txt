Great Lakes Biplane Model by Paul Jay Schrenker.

Release version: 11-11-2008

Carrara 5.1 Pro version is now included. It may work with other versions of Carrara, but there are no guarantees. You should be able to drag and drop the model to a suitable Carrara object browser directory, and update the directory in Carrara to see the model listed. (But for some reason the preview image wouldn't generate properly.) Propeller hub has the spin modifier applied, but is set at 0. Wheels have the SparrowHawke3D wheels modifier applied, but turned off. The SparrowHawke wheels modifier is a free download available at sparrowhawke3d.com. Also the control surfaces have constraints applied and hotpoints adjusted to allow for proper movement, they should be grouped together under the instances directory. Most materials are also set with proper shaders, so there's less setup involved. Enjoy!

HiPoly cockpit interior now has seats. Rear panel now has gages. All gages share a common template, so you may need to re-assign maps prior to render. Some additional details and textures for next release.

Release version: 6-18-2008

LoPoly and HighPoly versions have working meshes. Both versions now have finished UVs on the major surfaces. (Struts and other minor parts still unmapped.)

Interior cockpit details coming next for HighPoly version. 

Carrara version with most of the setup already done will be coming after the HighPoly OBJ version is complete.

Textures other than mapping guide tempates will also be added as progress continues.
